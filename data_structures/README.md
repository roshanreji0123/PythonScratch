# 🧩 Data Structures in Python

This folder contains programs exploring Python’s core data structures and how they are used to model simple real-world problems.  
Each script is small, focused, and designed to build clarity through hands-on examples.

## 📘 Contents
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `exploring_lists.py` | Basic list operations: indexing, slicing, mutability, adding/removing elements. |
| `studentdata_listbased.py` | Mini student-record system using nested lists (totals, averages, toppers). |
| `exploring_tuples.py` | Working with tuples, immutability, and tuple methods like `count()` and `index()`. |
| `sales_tuplebased.py` | Menu-driven sales viewer using tuples as grouped data. |
| `exploring_dicts.py` | Introduction to dictionaries and key–value storage. |
| `license_dictbased.py` | Simple dictionary-based student license register with age-eligibility logic. |
| `exploring_ranges.py` | Understanding the `range()` object and how it behaves in loops. |
| `recap.py` | A combined revision script covering lists, tuples, dictionaries, and ranges. |

## 🎯 Purpose
- Build a clear understanding of Python’s **mutable and immutable** structures  
- Learn how to choose the right structure for the right type of data  
- Strengthen logic and data modeling before working with databases or backend APIs  

---

## 🧠 Notes
- Each program is standalone and runnable  
- Focus is on clarity and concept-building rather than optimization  
- These fundamentals directly support future learning in **Django/FastAPI + MySQL**
