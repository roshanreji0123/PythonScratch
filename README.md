# 🐍 PythonScratch

A personal Python workspace where I learn, experiment, and build small programs to strengthen my logic, fundamentals, and understanding of how systems work.  
Each folder represents a focused area of learning — from core Python basics to data structures and logic-building exercises.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### **1. fundamentals/**
Core Python basics and exploration of functions, modularity, and simple number-processing logic.  
Contains foundational scripts that build understanding and clarity in Python syntax and execution.

---

### **2. exercises/**
Short, standalone Python programs focused on improving logic and problem-solving.  
Each file targets one concept — string processing, loops, decisions, and small algorithms.

---

### **3. data_structures/**
Programs exploring Python’s built-in data structures — **lists, tuples, dictionaries, and ranges** — with real-world style examples and a recap script.

---

### **4. projects/fastapi_demo/**
A small FastAPI practice module demonstrating backend fundamentals.

Contains:
- `get_request.py` → simple GET route  
- `post_request.py` → POST with request body  
- `mini_fastapiapp.py` → in-memory CRUD API using REST principles  

This folder marks the start of backend development with FastAPI.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening Python fundamentals through clear,structured programs  
- Understanding how logic builds into larger systems  
- Practicing data handling and flow — essential for backend development  
- Preparing to integrate Python with FastAPI and MySQL 
 
---

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions
This repository will gradually expand to include:
- Larger backend/API projects  
- Django / FastAPI practice modules  
- MySQL-integrated applications  
- More structured logic exercises and utilities
