# 🐍 PythonScratch

A personal Python workspace where I learn, experiment, and build small programs to strengthen my logic and problem-solving.  
Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained Python project — focused on one concept or idea at a time.

## 📂 Projects

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `number_analyzer` | Contains programs that analyze numbers — check if they’re prime, even, or odd, and perform range-based actions (factorial, divisors, or stars). Includes `functions_numbers.py` for modular logic and `import_functions.py` demonstrating imports and reusability. |
| *(more projects coming soon)* | Logic exercises, pattern programs, and experiments as I keep learning. |

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Writing clear, modular, and readable Python code  
- Understanding how Python executes logic internally  
- Strengthening fundamentals before exploring advanced concepts like backend and system design
