# 🐍 PythonScratch

A personal Python workspace where I learn, experiment, and build small programs to strengthen my logic, fundamentals, and understanding of how systems work.  
Each folder represents a focused area of learning — from core Python basics to data structures and logic-building exercises.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

### **1. fundamentals/**
Core Python basics and exploration of functions, modularity, and simple number-processing logic.  
Contains foundational scripts that build understanding and clarity in Python syntax and execution.

---

### **2. exercises/**
Short, standalone Python programs focused on improving logic and problem-solving.  
Each file targets one concept — string processing, loops, decisions, and small algorithms.

---

### **3. data_structures/**
Programs exploring Python’s built-in data structures — **lists, tuples, dictionaries, and ranges** — with real-world style examples and a recap script.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening Python fundamentals through small, focused programs  
- Understanding how logic builds into larger systems  
- Preparing for backend development by improving clarity in data handling and flow  
- Keeping learning structured and simple before moving into Django/FastAPI + MySQL  

---

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions
This repository will gradually expand to include:
- Small backend/API projects  
- Django / FastAPI practice modules  
- MySQL-integrated applications  
- More structured logic exercises and utilities
