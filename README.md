# 🐍 PythonScratch

A personal Python workspace where I learn, experiment, and build small programs to strengthen logic and problem-solving.  
Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained Python project — focused on one idea or concept at a time.

---

##  Projects
| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `number_analyzer` | Checks if a number is prime, even, or odd, and performs range-based actions (factorial, divisors, or stars). |
| *(more projects coming soon)* | Logic exercises, pattern programs, and small experiments as I keep learning. |

---

##  Current Focus
- Writing clear, modular, and readable code  
- Exploring how Python executes logic internally  
- Building a solid base before moving into advanced topics
