# 🐍 PythonScratch

A personal Python workspace where I learn, experiment, and build small programs to strengthen logic and problem-solving.  
Each file or folder in this repository represents a self-contained Python project — focused on one concept or idea at a time.

## 📂 Projects
| File/Folder | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| `number_analyzer.py` | The first version of the number analyzer — checks if a number is prime, even, or odd, and performs range-based actions like factorial, divisor listing, or star printing. |
| `functions_numbers.py` | A modular, improved version — breaks down the logic into separate functions for better structure, readability, and reuse. |
| `import_functions.py` | Demonstrates how to import and reuse functions from `functions_numbers.py` in another script. |
| `DataStructures/` | Contains programs exploring Python data structures — focusing on lists, nested lists, and real-world use cases of lists, tuples, and dictionaries. |
| *(more projects coming soon)* | Logic exercises, pattern programs, and experiments as I keep learning. |

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Writing clear, modular, and reusable Python code  
- Understanding how Python executes logic internally  
- Building a strong foundation before moving into advanced topics like backend development and system design
