# 🧩 Data Structures in Python

This folder contains programs exploring **Python data structures** and their practical applications in problem-solving.

## 📘 Contents
| File | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `exploring_lists.py` | Demonstrates basic list operations such as insertion, deletion, mutability, and core functions. |
| `studentdata_listbased.py` | A mini program managing student data using nested lists, computing totals, averages, and identifying toppers. |
| `exploring_tuples.py` | Demonstrates tuple operations such as `count()` and `index()`. |
| `sales_tuplebased.py` | A menu-driven program to record and view sales using tuples. |
| `exploring_dicts.py` | Demonstrates fundamental dictionary operations and key-value behavior. |
| `license_dictbased.py` | A menu-driven dictionary-based program that implements a Student License Register to determine driving eligibility by age. |

## 🎯 Purpose
This module aims to:
- Develop a deeper understanding of Python’s mutable and immutable data structures.
- Represent real-world problems using lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Strengthen logic-building skills and practical comprehension of core programming structures.

---

## 🧠 Notes
- Each program is standalone and can be executed directly.  
- The focus is on **clarity, structure, and logic** rather than algorithmic optimization.
