## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this module is to:
- Understand Python’s mutable and dynamic list behavior.
- Learn how to represent real-world data structures using nested lists.
- Prepare for more advanced data types like tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## 🧠 Notes
- Each program is standalone and can be run directly.
- Focus is on logic, readability, and clarity rather than optimization.
